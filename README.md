## Introduction of Vivifrail
"Vivifrail" is an international initiative aimed at promoting physical fitness training. Its purpose is to provide a reference for interventions in preventing frailty and falls among elderly individuals in both community and hospital settings.

This program is based on the principle that the health of older adults should be measured in terms of functionality rather than solely relying on factors such as average life expectancy, quality of life, level of dependency, and the prevalence of diseases. Its goal is to maintain the independence of older adults in various circumstances. (Excerpt from the official Vivifrail website)

## Problems & Solutions
1. Language Barrier: The original Vivifrail app is primarily in Spanish, which may not be convenient for elderly users in Taiwan who predominantly use Chinese or Taiwanese.
  &rarr; Using Chinese as our app's primary language.
2. Non-User-Friendly Interface:The original Vivifrail app's fonts and buttons are too small for the elderly to read and touch. It's also difficult for them to intuitively understand how to do next, and it lacks clear instructions to clarify the procedures.
3. Lack of Audio Assistance Feature: Some elderly individuals may have difficulty obtaining information solely through visual means and may require additional support such as audio assistance.
